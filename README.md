# Project with Data Structures and Algorithms

1.Idea:

Build a system of stores with their categories and products.


2.Requirements:

- Python3.8

- In this system we must be able to add and delete a product.

- The user must be able to search for a product by its name, where in stores, and in which category can find this product.


3.Setting up my GitHub Repository and Set up Git tracking in my directory, and commit changes as I make them.

**My Girgub Repo: https://github.com/scallopy/product_search**

4.Gather Data
In `script.py` I create my own minimal sets of data and show Data Structure of my Project and how algorithms work.

5.What I use in my Project?

- I use Tree data structures to store data in my project.

- I use quicksort algorithm to sort products by name after adding a new product.

- I use Breadth_First Algorithm to serch for a product by name and to save and show path to this product in the Data Structure.

6.Refactoring:
I removed unused code and add a user input to search for a product.

8. How to run:

- Clone project: `$ git clone git@github.com:scallopy/product_search.git`

- run sctipt: `$ python3.8 script.py`
